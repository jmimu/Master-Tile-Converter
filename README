Master Tile Converter (MTC) can export and import 3bpp and 4bpp
tiles in Sega Master System (SMS) roms.
It uses a portable QT interface.
You can see a simpler version in python in "simple_version" repertory.
Version 0.4.


TODO:
 * how to show more than 192 compressed tiles ?
 * when arrives at the end of the rom looking for compressed data, return to normal mode
 * read compressed data in rom, give number of tiles and bytes
 * import checks (palette)
 * add "undo" button!
 * update position in the rom at the end of compressed data searching
 * add default config in an external file (palette, mode, offset)


Usage :
 - load ROM
 - load palette (binary dump form meka)
 - find the perfect position in the rom where you want to work
 - select the good format (3bpp or 4 bpp)
 - select the correct part of the palette
 - export !

 - edit BMP in an external editor (don't modify the palette! don't change tiles with no meaning!)
(you can change the size of the picture)
* make your own graphics (respect size and palette)
* rearrange tiles to have the same layout as your dump (you may have to be pixel-precise!)
* add transparent for the tiles you don't want to change
* past it in the dump image in GIMP (it respects the palette)
* save it as you new image

 - back in MTC, if you are in the correct position, import your BMP.
 - Save the resulting rom.
Done !
