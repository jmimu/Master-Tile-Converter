Master Tile Converter (MTC) can export and import 3bpp and 4bpp
tiles in Sega Master System (SMS) roms.
It uses a portable QT interface.
You can see a simpler version in python in "simple_version" repertory.
Version 0.8.


TODO:
 * set working dir where rom is (for picture, asm...)
 * add "undo" button!
 * try to remove palette dependency for rom
 * Add Mark III support?


Usage :
 - load ROM
 - load palette (binary dump form meka) or extract palette from ROM if you know its adress
 - find the perfect position in the rom where you want to work, or find compressed picture
 - select the good format (1bpp, 2bpp, 3bpp or 4 bpp)
 - select the correct palette and the correct part
 - export !

 - edit BMP in an external editor (don't modify the palette! don't change tiles with no meaning!)
(you can change the size of the picture)
* make your own graphics (respect size and palette)
* rearrange tiles to have the same layout as your dump (you may have to be pixel-precise!)
* add transparent for the tiles you don't want to change
* past it in the dump image in GIMP (it respects the palette)
* save it as you new image

 - back in MTC, if you are in the correct position, import your BMP.
 - Save the resulting rom.
Done !

 - you can save your work as a project, to be able to record your bookmarks and palettes.

 - MTC can also be used to determine where may be an uncompressed palette in rom from a palette exported by an emulator
