TODO:
 * make Alexkidd the default palette
 * if 3bpp, export a bmp with only 8 colors
 * import checks (palette, bmp..)
 * add help
 * add default config in an external file (palette, mode, offset)
 * add copyright
 * make a webpage...


Usage :
 - load ROM
 - load palette (binary dump form meka)
 - find the perfect position in the rom where you want to work
 - select the good format (3bpp or 4 bpp)
 - select the correct part of the palette
 - export !

 - edit BMP in an external editor (don't modify the palette ! don't change tiles with no meaning !)

 - back in ???, if you are in the correct position, import your BMP.
 - Save the resulting rom.
Done ! (you may have to correct the rom checksum)
